***Contents (old)***:

Relative to the directory in which this file is contained, you may find the following:

 ./data - Contains CSV files generated by the program to generate the graphs in the report.
 ./docs - Contains the report and UML diagram.
 ./src - Contains all the C++ source code required to perform the experiments.
 ./CMakeLists.txt - Used by CMake to allow cross-platform building of this C++ project.

***Running the program***:

To build this program on eceubuntu, first, within the same folder as this README file,
call "cmake ."; this initializes the CMake configuration. After this is done,
call "cmake --build ." to build the binary.

To run the program after building with CMake, call "./bin/ECE358-L2".

The program will automatically show a list of commands, their usage and description.
Very rigorous error-checking was implemented.

This program was designed to be able to perform multiple simulations and generate
multiple CSV outputs in a single session, also allowing you to change multiple simulation
parameters in on line.

See the report for the exact commands used to gather each data point or generate each graph.
